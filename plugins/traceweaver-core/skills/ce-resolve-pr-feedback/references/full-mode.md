# Full Mode

Read this reference when Mode Detection (in SKILL.md) routes to **Full Mode** — no argument given, a PR number was provided, or a whole-PR URL (`.../pull/N` with no comment fragment) was provided. Full mode processes all unresolved threads on the PR. When the argument is a PR URL, parse the host, `OWNER/REPO`, and number from it, then require both host and repository to match the current checkout's exact `origin`.

The shape: **fetch once, judge centrally, fan out only the fixes.** The orchestrator (you) holds every thread from a single fetch, so the legitimacy judgment happens in your context — where you can dedup reads, spot a systematically-wrong reviewer across threads, and weigh the author's design intent. Subagents are dispatched only to *implement* fixes you've already approved. Do not fan out the judgment: spinning a subagent per thread to decide validity re-pays per-agent overhead, re-reads the same files, and throws away the cross-thread view — and you'd pay it even for threads that turn out to be skips.

## 1. Fetch Unresolved Threads

If no PR number was provided, detect from the current branch:
```bash
gh pr view --json number -q .number
```

Then fetch all feedback using the GraphQL script at [scripts/get-pr-comments](../scripts/get-pr-comments). Set `SKILL_DIR` to the absolute directory you loaded the ce-resolve-pr-feedback SKILL.md from — the Bash tool's CWD is the user's project, not the skill dir, and shell state does not persist between Bash calls, so set it inline in each block below that runs a bundled script. If the bundled script is missing on disk the call fails plainly; fall back to the `gh` commands shown after this block.

**GitHub origin boundary.** Resolve the current checkout's `origin` host and
`OWNER/REPO` first.
A supplied PR URL must use HTTPS and its host must exactly match that origin
host and repository before any `gh` command runs. Never let a URL select an
arbitrary `GH_HOST`, another same-host repository, or redirect requests to
another authenticated target. Fork-to-upstream resolution is held unless the
checkout's `origin` is the PR repository. On a matching GitHub Enterprise
origin, pass `GH_HOST=<origin-host>` inline on every bundled-script read. On
`github.com`, omit the prefix.

```bash
ORIGIN_URL=$(git remote get-url origin);
ORIGIN_HOST=$(printf '%s' "$ORIGIN_URL" | sed -E 's#^(https?://|ssh://([^@/]+@)?|[^@]+@)([^/:]+).*#\3#');
ORIGIN_REPOSITORY=$(printf '%s' "$ORIGIN_URL" | sed -E 's#^(https?://[^/]+/|ssh://([^@/]+@)?[^/]+/|[^:]+:)##; s#\.git$##');
PR_URL="<pr-url-if-one-was-passed>";
PR_HOST=$(python3 -c 'import sys; from urllib.parse import urlparse; u=urlparse(sys.argv[1]); print(u.hostname or "") if u.scheme=="https" else sys.exit(2)' "$PR_URL") || exit 1;
PR_REPOSITORY=$(python3 -c 'import sys; from urllib.parse import urlparse; p=[x for x in urlparse(sys.argv[1]).path.split("/") if x]; print("/".join(p[:2])) if len(p)>=4 and p[2]=="pull" else sys.exit(2)' "$PR_URL") || exit 1;
[ -z "$PR_HOST" ] || [ "$PR_HOST" = "$ORIGIN_HOST" ] || { echo "PR host must match checkout origin host" >&2; exit 1; };
[ -z "$PR_REPOSITORY" ] || [ "$PR_REPOSITORY" = "$ORIGIN_REPOSITORY" ] || { echo "PR repository must match checkout origin repository" >&2; exit 1; };
echo "$ORIGIN_HOST"
```

```bash
SKILL_DIR="<absolute path of the directory containing the ce-resolve-pr-feedback SKILL.md>";
GH_HOST=<derived-host> bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/get-pr-comments" PR_NUMBER OWNER/REPO   # omit GH_HOST=<derived-host> on github.com
```

Pass the origin-matching `OWNER/REPO` as the second arg. The helper independently
derives the origin repository and refuses any different value, including a
same-host repository. Every `get-pr-comments` call below (fetch and verify)
takes the same exact origin `OWNER/REPO`.

Returns a JSON object with four keys:

| Key | Contents | Has file/line? | Resolvable? |
|-----|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `pending_review` | Node ID of your own unsubmitted (PENDING) review on this PR, or `null` | n/a | n/a |
| `review_threads` | Unresolved inline code review threads (includes outdated; each carries its `isOutdated` flag so line drift can be accounted for) | Yes | Yes (GraphQL) |
| `pr_comments` | Top-level PR conversation comments (excludes PR author) | No | No |
| `review_bodies` | Review submission bodies with non-empty text (excludes PR author) | No | No |

**Stop here if `pending_review` is non-null.** Thread replies posted while you hold an unsubmitted review are absorbed into that draft: the reply call returns a comment ID and URL as if it succeeded, but nothing is visible to the reviewer until the draft is submitted. Do not proceed into steps 2-8 — the fixes would land while every reply silently disappeared. Tell the user they have an unsubmitted review on the PR, that it must be submitted or discarded before this skill can reply, and stop. Do not submit or discard it yourself; a draft review is unsent human writing.

If the script fails, fall back to:
```bash
gh pr view PR_NUMBER --json reviews,comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments
```

## 2. Triage: Separate New from Pending

Before processing, classify each piece of feedback as **new** or **already handled**.

**Review threads**: Read the thread's comments. If there's a substantive reply that acknowledges the concern but defers action (e.g., "need to align on this", "going to think through this", or a reply that presents options without resolving), it's a **pending decision** -- don't re-process. If there's only the original reviewer comment(s) with no substantive response, it's **new**.

**PR comments and review bodies**: These have no resolve mechanism, so they reappear on every run. Apply two filters in order:

1. **Actionability**: Skip items that contain no actionable feedback or questions to answer. Examples: review wrapper text ("Here are some automated review suggestions..."), approvals ("this looks great!"), status badges ("Validated"), CI summaries with no follow-up asks. If there's nothing to fix, answer, or decide, it's not actionable -- drop it from the count entirely.
2. **Already replied**: For actionable items, check the PR conversation for an existing reply that quotes and addresses the feedback. If a reply already exists, skip. If not, it's new.

The distinction is about content, not who posted what. A deferral from a teammate, a previous skill run, or a manual reply all count. Similarly, actionability is about content -- bot feedback that requests a specific code change is actionable; a bot's boilerplate header wrapping those requests is not.

**Silent drop.** Non-actionable items are dropped without narration. Do not announce, list, or count dropped items in conversation, the task list, or the step 9 summary. Review-bot wrappers from CodeRabbit, Codex, Gemini Code Assist, and Copilot (bodies like "Here are some automated review suggestions...") commonly appear here -- recognize them by their boilerplate content, drop silently. The fetch layer pre-filters only blank bodies and messages from the known PR author. All external identities and surfaces, including CI/status bots such as Codecov, rely on this content-aware check so identity reuse or format changes cannot silently hide actionable feedback.

If there are no new items across all feedback types, skip steps 3-8 and go straight to step 9.

## 3. Consolidate & Decide (the legitimacy gate)

This is the gate. Judge every **new** item here, in your own context, before any fix is dispatched. Apply the rubric in [references/evaluation-rubric.md](evaluation-rubric.md) (read it now) across the whole batch at once.

Working over the full set lets you do what a per-thread subagent can't:
- **Dedup reads by file** — read a file once and judge all its threads together.
- **Cross-item reasoning** — cluster findings by root assumption; a source (often a bot) that's wrong in one place is suspect across its siblings; converging requests from independent reviewers are a strong fix signal.
- **Selective depth** — clear nits need only the comment plus the diff line; deep-read (callers, invariants, `git blame`/PR rationale for author intent) only where a finding is contestable or the code looks deliberate. That deep read on the contestable minority is what catches a confidently-wrong reviewer.

Produce a verdict per item and sort into three lists:

- **fix-list** — `fixed` / `fixed-differently`. These get dispatched to fixers in step 4. For each, note the file/location (and for outdated threads, the resolved location or anchor) and a one-line "what to change." **Class fix:** when the cross-item pass (rubric: "A validated finding can span sites this PR itself introduced") found equivalent same-invariant sites this PR touched, record them as **one** fix-list item that enumerates every concrete location (`file:line`) and lists every feedback ID it covers — one class item → one fixer (step 4), so the sites are edited coherently and every covered thread/comment is replied-to and resolved from that single result. Enumerate only sites whose treatment is unambiguous; a site needing its own judgment stays a separate item.
- **reply-list** — `replied` / `not-addressing` / `declined`. No code change. Compose the reply text now per the rubric (you have the evidence) and carry it to step 7.
- **human-list** — `needs-human`. Compose `decision_context` now; carry to steps 7 and 9.

Create a task list of all new items (e.g., `TaskCreate` in Claude Code, `update_plan` in Codex) tagged with their verdict, so progress is visible.

**At scale.** If the batch is large (many threads spanning many files) and judging them all inline would overflow your context, process the consolidation in groups (e.g., file-clustered groups of ~8-10 threads), emitting the three lists incrementally. Don't fan the judgment out to subagents to avoid this — batch it instead.

If the fix-list is empty (all verdicts are reply/needs-human), skip steps 4-6 and go to step 7.

## 4. Fix (PARALLEL — fix-list only)

Dispatch fixers **only** for fix-list items. Reply-list and human-list items never reach a subagent.

### Dispatch

Read [references/agents/pr-comment-resolver.md](agents/pr-comment-resolver.md) and spawn a generic subagent seeded with that fixer prompt for each fix-list item. Do not dispatch a standalone agent by type/name. The fixer is a pure executor: the validity judgment is already done, so it implements and returns — it does not re-judge worthwhileness.

Each fixer receives:
- The feedback_id (thread ID or comment ID) and feedback type.
- The file path and location fields: `line`, `originalLine`, `startLine`, `originalStartLine` (for outdated threads, the resolved location/anchor from step 3).
- The reviewer's comment text.
- Your step-3 note: what to change and why it was judged valid.
- The PR number.

For `pr_comment` / `review_body` fix-list items (no file/line), the fixer identifies the relevant files from the comment text and the PR diff.

### Fixer return format

Each resolver returns a short summary:
- **verdict**: `fixed`, `fixed-differently`, `replied`, `not-addressing`, `declined`, or `needs-human`
- **feedback_id**: the thread ID or comment ID it handled
- **feedback_type**: `review_thread`, `pr_comment`, or `review_body`
- **reply_text**: the draft markdown reply (quoting the relevant part of the original feedback)
- **files_changed**: list of files modified (empty if replied/not-addressing)
- **reason**: brief explanation of what was done or why it was skipped

**Handling `blocked`.** A fixer returns `blocked` only when implementing surfaced a concrete contradiction its narrower view exposed (the change breaks a caller/test it can see, or the code isn't what the finding described). Re-evaluate it yourself with that evidence: either re-dispatch with a corrected instruction, or move it to the reply-list (`not-addressing`/`declined`) or human-list. Don't silently drop it.

### Batching and conflict avoidance

**Batching**: If the fix-list has 1-4 items, dispatch all in parallel. For 5+, batch in groups of 4.

**Conflict avoidance**: No two fixers that touch the same file run in parallel. You already know the target files from step 3 — serialize fixers that share a file (dispatch one, wait, then the next); non-overlapping items run in parallel. For a **class item**, feed the fixer its full enumerated location set and every covered feedback ID (not a single thread), and account for **all** of its sites in this check — a class fix touching files another fixer also touches must be serialized against every one of them. When one fixer handles multiple threads on the same file, it addresses them sequentially.

**Sequential fallback**: Platforms that do not support parallel dispatch run fixers sequentially.

Fixes can occasionally expand beyond their referenced file (e.g., renaming a method updates callers elsewhere). This is rare but can cause parallel fixers to collide. Step 5 (combined validation) catches test breakage; step 8 (verify) catches unresolved threads. If either surfaces inconsistent changes, re-run the affected fixers sequentially.

## 5. Validate Combined State

Aggregate `files_changed` across every fixer summary. If it's empty, skip steps 5 and 6 and proceed to step 7.

Fixers run only targeted tests on their own changes. This step runs the project's full validation **once** against the combined diff to catch cross-agent interactions that targeted runs can't see.

1. **Run the project's validation command** (test suite, type check, or whatever the project's active conventions specify). Run once, not per-agent.

2. **Green** -> proceed to step 6.

3. **Red, failures touch files resolvers changed** -> one inline diagnose-and-fix pass. Re-run validation. If still red, escalate with a `needs-human` item containing the test output; do **not** publish.

4. **Red, failures touch only files no resolver changed** -> treat as pre-existing. Proceed to step 6, but add a footer to the held publication handoff: `Note: pre-existing failure in <test> not addressed by this PR.`

Record the validation outcome (command run, pass/fail counts, any pre-existing failures noted) for the step 9 summary.

## 6. TraceWeaver Alpha Stop Before Commit and Push

Do not stage files, create commits, push branches, open PRs, post issue or PR
replies, or resolve review threads from this packaged alpha surface.

Prepare a draft-only publication handoff instead:

1. List only files reported by sub-agents.
2. Record validation command and result.
3. Draft a proposed commit message referencing the PR:
   `Address PR review feedback (#PR_NUMBER)`.
4. Keep all changes local and uncommitted until a future TraceWeaver
   publication gate explicitly approves branch mutation.

## 7. Draft Replies and Held Thread Resolution

After validation, draft replies and resolution intent. Do not post replies,
posting PR comments, or resolving review threads from this packaged alpha
surface.

### Reply format

All replies quote the relevant part of the original feedback for continuity — the specific sentence or passage, not the entire comment if it's long. The per-verdict templates are in [references/evaluation-rubric.md](evaluation-rubric.md) (skip verdicts) and [references/agents/pr-comment-resolver.md](agents/pr-comment-resolver.md) (`fixed` / `fixed-differently`).

For `needs-human` verdicts, draft the natural-sounding reply but do NOT resolve
the thread. Leave it open for human input.

### Review threads

0. **Verify the thread ID** before replying. GitHub Enterprise can return inconsistent node IDs for the same thread depending on the query path. Always confirm the ID from `get-pr-comments` resolves to the correct thread using [scripts/get-thread-for-comment](../scripts/get-thread-for-comment) with the comment's numeric URL ID. Extract the numeric comment ID from the comment URL (e.g. `discussion_r2589700` → `2589700`) for the `gh api` call; if the bundled script is missing, use `gh api` to inspect the review thread instead:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="<absolute path of the directory containing the ce-resolve-pr-feedback SKILL.md>";
GH_HOST=<derived-host> GH_REPO=OWNER/REPO gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/COMMENT_ID --jq .node_id
GH_HOST=<derived-host> bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/get-thread-for-comment" PR_NUMBER COMMENT_NODE_ID OWNER/REPO
```
The returned `id` is the authoritative thread ID to use for reply and resolve. If it differs from what `get-pr-comments` returned, use the one from this script.

1. **Draft reply only.** Record `THREAD_ID`, the quoted reviewer context, and
   `REPLY_TEXT` in the held publication handoff. If a bundled helper is missing
   or blocked, stop with that draft intact. Never fall back to a mutating
   `gh api --method POST`, `gh pr review`, or `/reviews` request from this
   packaged alpha surface.

For `needs-human` verdicts, draft the reply but do NOT resolve the thread. Leave it open for human input.

### Review threads

0. **Verify the thread ID** before replying. GitHub Enterprise can return inconsistent node IDs for the same thread depending on the query path. Always confirm the ID from `get-pr-comments` resolves to the correct thread using [scripts/get-thread-for-comment](../scripts/get-thread-for-comment) with the comment's numeric URL ID:
```bash
GH_HOST=<derived-host> GH_REPO=OWNER/REPO gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/COMMENT_ID --jq .body
```
The returned `id` is the authoritative thread ID to use for reply and resolve. If it differs from what `get-pr-comments` returned, use the one from this script.

1. **Draft reply** by recording `THREAD_ID` and `REPLY_TEXT` in the held handoff.
2. **Draft resolution intent** by listing thread IDs that should be resolved
   after an approved publication gate. For `needs-human`, keep the thread open.

### PR comments and review bodies

These cannot be resolved via GitHub's API. Draft a top-level PR comment
referencing the original, but do not post it from this packaged alpha surface.

The same escaping rule applies here: compose the body in a quoted heredoc so paragraph breaks are real newlines, and confirm the posted comment renders as Markdown rather than one line containing literal `\n`.

Include enough quoted context in the reply so the reader can follow which comment is being addressed without scrolling.

## 8. Verify

Re-fetch feedback only as read-only context when needed:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="<absolute path of the directory containing the ce-resolve-pr-feedback SKILL.md>";
GH_HOST=<derived-host> bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/get-pr-comments" PR_NUMBER OWNER/REPO
```

Because publication is held, the `review_threads` array is not expected to be
empty yet. Use the read-only output to verify that the draft handoff targets the
right currently-open items.

**If new threads remain**, check the iteration count for this run:

- **First or second fix-verify cycle**: Repeat from step 2 for the remaining threads.

- **After the second fix-verify cycle** (3rd pass would begin): Stop looping. Surface remaining issues to the user with context about the recurring pattern: "Multiple rounds of feedback on [area/theme] suggest a deeper issue. Here's what we've fixed so far and what keeps appearing." Use the same `needs-human` escalation pattern -- leave threads open and present the pattern for the user to decide.

PR comments and review bodies have no resolve mechanism, so they will still
appear in the output. Verify that each actionable item has draft reply text in
the held handoff.

## 9. Summary

Present a concise summary of all work done. Group by verdict, one line per item describing *what was done* not just *where*. This is the primary output the user sees — and the place where the gate's decisions become visible: the user can see exactly what was fixed, what was skipped, and why.

Format:

```
Resolved N of M new items on PR #NUMBER:

Fixed (count): [brief description of each fix]
Fixed differently (count): [what was changed and why the approach differed]
Replied (count): [what questions were answered]
Not addressing (count): [what was skipped and the evidence]
Declined (count): [what was declined and the harm cited]

Validation: [one line -- e.g., "bun test passed (893/893)" or "bun test passed with pre-existing failure in X noted"; omit when no code changes were prepared]
Publication: held -- no commit, push, PR comment, or thread resolution performed
```

If any item is `needs-human`, append a decisions section. These are rare but high-signal. Each carries a `decision_context` (composed in step 3, or by a fixer's escalation): what the reviewer said, what was investigated, why it needs a decision, concrete options with tradeoffs, and a lean if any.

Present the `decision_context` directly -- it's already structured for the user to decide quickly:

```
Needs your input (count):

1. [decision_context -- quoted feedback, investigation findings, why it
   needs a decision, options with tradeoffs, and the recommendation if any]
```

The `needs-human` threads have draft acknowledgment replies and remain open on the PR.

If there are **pending decisions from a previous run** (threads detected in step 2 as already responded to but still unresolved), surface them after the new work:

```
Still pending from a previous run (count):

1. [Thread path:line] -- [brief description of what's pending]
   Previous reply: [link to the existing reply]
   [Re-present the decision options if available, or summarize what was asked]
```

If a blocking question tool is available, use it to ask about all pending decisions (both new `needs-human` and previous-run pending) together. If there are only pending decisions and no new work was done, the summary is just the pending items.

Use the platform's blocking question tool: `AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code (call `ToolSearch` with `select:AskUserQuestion` first if its schema isn't loaded), `request_user_input` in Codex, `ask_question` in Antigravity CLI (`agy`), `ask_user` in Pi (requires the `pi-ask-user` extension). Use it to present the decisions and wait for the user's response. After they decide, process the remaining items: fix the code, compose the reply, and keep posting/resolution held for an explicit TraceWeaver publication gate.

Fall back to presenting the decisions in the summary output and waiting in conversation only when no blocking tool exists in the harness or the call errors (e.g., Codex edit modes) — not because a schema load is required. Never silently skip. If the user doesn't respond, the items remain open on the PR for later handling.
